Belly Button Biodiversity
Descripton
This is an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset (you can also locate it in data/samples.json), which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.

The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

Dashboard Features
Drop Down Menu

Select the Test Subject ID No. with the drop down menu to toggle the visualizations (bar, gauge, bubble charts)


Demographic Info Panel

This Panel shows the demographics information of the chosen test subject
Displays each key-value pair from the metadata JSON object


Horizontal Bar Graph

A bar chart is generated when a test subject is selected on the drop menu
The top 10 OTUs found in that test subject will be displayed in bars, where the sample_values are presented as the values for the bar chart and the otu_ids presented as the labels for the bar chart
When a user hover over a bar, the otu_labels are presented as the hovertext for the chart

Gauge Chart

A gauge chart is generated when a test subject is selected on the drop menu
The value of srubs per week (wfreq) is display on chart with a blue colored bar


Bubble Chart

A bubble chart is generated when a test subject is selected on the drop menu
Each sample will be display as a bubble, where the larger the sample value is the larger the bubble size
On the chart, the x values are the otu_ids, the y values are the sample_values
The colors of the bubbles are based on otu_ids, and the hovertext are the otu_labels
